## Steps

## New concepts

| Concept | Go | Python |
|---|---|---|
| Logging | `log` [ðŸ”—](https://golang.org/pkg/log/) | `logging` [ðŸ”—](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) |
| Synchronizing threaded execution | The `go` keyword and channels [ðŸ”—](https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/2) | Possible to implement with a combination of [threads](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/threading.html) and a [queue](https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html) |
| Loops | only `for` [ðŸ”—](https://tour.golang.org/flowcontrol/1) | `for` and `while` [ðŸ”—](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Loops) |
| Interfaces | No inheritance, instead [interface definitions](https://tour.golang.org/methods/10) and [struct embedding](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#embedding) | [Classical inheritance](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_inheritance.asp) |
| Methods | Functions with [receivers](https://tour.golang.org/methods/1) | As part of the [class definition](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-objects) |
