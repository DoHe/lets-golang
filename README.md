## Setup

### Installing go

1. Download go binary from here: [https://golang.org/dl](https://golang.org/dl/) (please install a version `>= 1.11`)
2. Follow the install instructions here: [https://golang.org/doc/install](https://golang.org/doc/install#install)
3. (Optional) Install go extension for visual studio code: [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go)

### `GOPATH` and go modules

This project uses go modules so you can clone it to wherever you like, it does _not_ have to been in your `GOPATH`. If you want to have in your `GOPATH` anyway, you might have to set the environment variable `GO111MODULE=on` depending on your go version.
