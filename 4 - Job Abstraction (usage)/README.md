# 4. Job Abstraction (usage)

## Steps

* Write a vexbot job (`jobs/vexbot.go`), equivalent to (`jobs/hexbot.go`)
* Start both jobs in the main
  * Use the `go` keyword to start a new goroutine
  * Create a channel and pass it to the jobs
  * Wait on the channel until both jobs have send a message
  * Use a type assertion switch/case to print what job the received `JobResult` came from
