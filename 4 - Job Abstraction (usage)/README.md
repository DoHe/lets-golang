# 4. Job Abstraction (usage)

## Steps

* Write a vexbot job (`jobs/vexbot.go`), equivalent to (`jobs/hexbot.go`)
* Start both jobs in the main
  * Use the `go` keyword to start a new goroutine
  * Create a channel and pass it to the jobs
  * Wait on the channel until both jobs have send a message
  * Use a type assertion switch/case to print what job the received `JobResult` came from

| Concept | Go | Python |
|---|---|---|
| Synchronizing threaded execution | The `go` keyword and channels [ðŸ”—](https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/2) | Possible to implement with a combination of [threads](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/threading.html) and a [queue](https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html) |
| Loops | only `for` [ðŸ”—](https://tour.golang.org/flowcontrol/1) | `for` and `while` [ðŸ”—](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Loops) |
| Type assertion | `.(type)` [ðŸ”—](https://tour.golang.org/methods/15) | `isinstance` [ðŸ”—](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functions.html#isinstance) |
